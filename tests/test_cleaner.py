Tests for the joke cleaning functionality.

These tests ensure that our cleaning logic correctly:
- Removes obvious explanations without harming punchlines  
- Preserves multi-sentence jokes where both sentences are essential
- Retains Q and A patterns correctly
- Removes parenthetical explanations while preserving parenthetical puns
